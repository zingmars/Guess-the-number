Guess-the-number is yet another C++ implementation of the "Guess the number" game, except that this one has a lot
of random code that a random beginner wouldn't add. I did this to make a "foolproof" game, which cannot be broken
by entering some random text. To run this - just copy-pase the code from main.cpp into your ide/text editor, and 
compile the thing OR download the debug build executable from "/Debug" folder. Windows only.
Also, this was made to test out how github works.

Changes done:
27.05.11 - Did pretty much everything I wanted to, and dumped the code in pastebin.ca
18.07.11 - Pulled the source code from pastebin.ca (the site seemed to be dead, used google which had the cached version
of the site. Decided to do some changes. Did the following - 
1. Hopefully made the code look a bit more organized. Hopefully...
2. The original code asked you numbers from 1 to 100. I changed this to go from 1 to 1 million
3. Commented my code a bit more, adding probably 100 more useless comments.
4. ALMOST Added a cls command which clears the screen, and removed the weird spacing.

TO-DO:
1. Make a system that shows a message depending on how close the generated number is to the one entered by the user.
Sort of like - "It's getting colder (when the number entered is further away from the generated than the previous one)"
and "It's getting hotter (the reverse situation)".
2. Fix the CLS command, which displays some unwanted things when executed.

NOTES:
1. The /1000 randomly generated numbers thing is there for no reason. Then again - you have to be extremely dedicated
to actually guess so many numbers in one session.
